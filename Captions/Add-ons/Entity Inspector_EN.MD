### OVERVIEW
Entity Inspector provides auto-generated UI for your data model entities. It allows you to browse, create, update and remove entity instances without creating any specific UI. Also, if your entity is soft-deleted, Entity Inspector lets you browse, restore or wipe out deleted instances.

Entity Inspector respects data access constraints imposed by security, so it can be helpful both for administrators and for users with limited permissions.

### INSTALLATION
To include Entity Inspector in your application, add the following lines to the dependencies section of your build.gradle file:
