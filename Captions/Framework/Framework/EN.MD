### Based on Spring Framework
Jmix naturally adopts features of Spring, so you can rely on its wide ecosystem and apply your expertise gained before.
If youâ€™re new to Spring, Jmix provides a guided way to get started.
### Modular
The enterprise-grade architecture makes modularization practically trivial - split your task into a number of loosely coupled parts, develop them separately and assemble together into a comprehensive solution. As an example, check out a wide range of commonly used add-ons available on the Jmix marketplace.
### Scalable
The framework is designed to be scalable both vertically and horizontally. It provides an API and tools to deploy your application in highly-available configuration both on premise or in the clouds.
### Compatible
Jmix applications are compatible with most popular RDBMS and run in any Java servlet container. They can be distributed as WAR, Docker, UberJar.
### BACKOFFICE UI
Generic UI module is aimed for the rapid development of backoffice and administrative frontends in Java or other JVM languages. It provides a rich collection of UI components with seamless data-binding along with all necessary infrastructure for data manipulation and validation, business logic invocation, internationalization, session management, access control and more.
### REST API
Generic REST API supports authentication, CRUD operations, custom data fetching and business logic invocation. Swagger documentation is generated automatically, so it can be easily integrated with a third party system or consumed by any client application.
### CUSTOMER-FACING UI
Unlike backoffice frontends, customer-facing UI often implies mobile-first design with unique elements and high load requirements. In response, Jmix provides TypeScript SDK and a generator to boost the development of React or React Native frontends.
### Packed with enterprise features
The framework is sponsored by Haulmont, an enterprise software development house with over 10 years history. CUBA originated as an internal tool and now plays central role in the company used in over 500 productions systems worldwide.
