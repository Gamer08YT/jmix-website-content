   Corporate-level Talent Management IT System in 6.5 Months
     * 3 developers, 6.5 months
     * 65 000 careers managed
     * Project turned into an international SaaS product

The Story

   UCO is an IT consulting and software development company active
   in Kazakhstan. One of the professional areas they cover is HR
   management systems. One of UCO’s customers required a new HR
   system that would manage recruiting, training, career
   development and other crucial processes.

   Following the client’s needs, UCO was looking for a way to
   deliver a functional enterprise-level HR management system.

   Since existing products did not fit into the customer
   requirements for multiple reasons, the team decided to develop
   the system from scratch using Jmix (formerly known as CUBA
   Platform). A PoC on Jmix was approved, and the full-scale
   system was delivered in the shortest time possible.

Extending the Success

   The system was built on Jmix by a small team of 3 developers in
   just 6,5 months and is now used to track careers of 65000
   employees in several companies. Specially created for large
   corporations, the system allows managing all processes related
   to staff hiring, educating, motivating, and promoting.

   The first intention was to save time at the Proof of Concept
   stage. After the PoC was approved, UCO fully relied on Jmix and
   Premium Add-ons to deliver a fully functional system, featuring
   the following modules:
     * Multi-Recruiting
     * KPI-based Goal Setting and Control
     * Competence Matching
     * Points of Professional Growth
     * Certification
     * Learning Management
     * Foreign Language Courses
     * Personal Career Development
     * Regular Testing

   In a year after the system implementation, UCO launched the
   product internationally under the SaaS model.
