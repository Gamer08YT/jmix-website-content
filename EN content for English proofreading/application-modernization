Application Modernization

Fostering legacy modernization
with the balanced approach

   Legacy applications still do the heavy lifting of running the
   business. Business stakeholders ask for changes to keep up the
   pace of competition, but business logic complexity is a good
   reason to keep legacy alive. IT Leaders find modernizing
   without disrupting the business run a challenging engineering
   task.

   Typical Low Code platforms promise fast modernization but
   introduce high license costs and often fail to handle the
   complexity. At the same time, traditional development is
   expensive and slow. Jmix general purpose high productivity
   application platform balances between the Low Code speed and
   traditional development flexibility.

   side-by-side with the legacy one, synchronizing data to keep
   both systems run in parallel. Sunset features one by one, until
   you can discontinue the whole old system.
