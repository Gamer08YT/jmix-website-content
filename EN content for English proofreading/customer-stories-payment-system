   A Government Billing System from Scratch by Card Access
   Services
     * A state-scale system from scratch in 1 year
     * The whole country’s payment system digitalized
     * Significat state financial losses reduction

The Story

   At the beginning of 2019, the Card Access Services (CAS) team
   started working on a project for the Brunei government. The
   customer had no clear idea of the final product, so the team
   started to work without formal functional requirements. The
   only thing the CAS team knew for sure was that the system
   should perform plenty of operations beyond the payments
   processing, and the web interface must be very user-friendly,
   so that everyone in Brunei could easily work with it.

   So, the CAS team was searching for a framework that provided
   out-of-the-box features for building full-scale informational
   systems with in-built security and tools for the UI design.
   Jmix (back then known as CUBA) turned out to be a perfect fit
   for the project.

   Jmix features helped to adapt the development to the constantly
   changing requirements and saved a huge amount of time. The
   project was launched in February 2020. It was a real
   break-through for the Brunei government: electronic payments
   were never used before. That way, CAS converted the whole
   country’s payment system into electronic form, making it
   possible to pay for electricity, water, registration, license,
   art gallery tickets and many other things online.

Result

   The delivered product not only made payments easier for the
   citizens, but also helped to reduce financial losses and avoid
   the necessity of huge debt recovery efforts.
