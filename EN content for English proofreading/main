       future-proof technology stack is capable to support various
       digital initiatives across the organization.
    3. 02

Improve business resilience
       Jmix applications are indeed yours and can be supported
       independently thanks to open-source runtime utilizing
       mainstream technologies. Your data is secure with a
       server-side frontend development model and fine-grained
       access control.
    4. 03

       Any Java or Kotlin developer is a full-stack Jmix developer
       - you don’t need separate backend and frontend teams.
       Visual tools help onboarding developers who have little
       experience or move from an obsolete stack.

Modernize your applications
       Jmix’s data centric approach and a single development
       language make it a natural fit to migrate legacy
       applications.

Build with confidence
       Jmix developers work with widely adopted open-source stack
       and convenient API instead of relying on proprietary black
       box frameworks.
    7. 06

Cut license costs
       Unlike most application development platforms, there are no
       fees for using the applications you’ve built.
    8. 07

Get more projects done faster

       and ready-to-use components.
