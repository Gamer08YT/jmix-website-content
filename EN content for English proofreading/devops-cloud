DevOps Cloud is currently
in development and coming soon

Entirely in line with Jmix philosophy, Jmix DevOps Cloud does not
lock you into a proprietary environment. Instead, it bridges the gaps
between development tools, DevOps infrastructure and public clouds.

   The core of DevOps Cloud is GitLab, so you have access to all
   the features of the leading DevOps platform. On top of GitLab
   features, DevOps Cloud offers:
     * Seamless integration with Jmix Studio
     * Preconfigured CI/CD pipelines
     * Automatic procurement of development and test environments
     * Completely automated deployment to AWS, Yandex.Cloud or to
       a self-hosted Kubernetes instance
     * Governance policies, including projects and environments
       access
