Frequently Asked Questions
       ______________________________________________________

   (BUTTON) Who is the Jmix developer?

   Jmix is built for professional developers. But software
   engineers who are still working with an outdated technology
   stack or newcomers with basic Java knowledge can adopt Jmix and
   be productive! Jmix defines application architecture and guides
   you to roll out the app to the web easily.
   (BUTTON) How long does it take to start productive development?

   Assuming you know Java, it usually takes 1-2 weeks. If not –
   1-2 months. We recommend starting with [13]Jmix Quickstart and
   [14]Video tutorials for faster onboarding.
   (BUTTON) Do you have training programs?

     [13] https://www.jmix.io/learn/quickstart/
     [14] https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf3PjP4Afu3MEPezjiEKodoYIPMEAAgn8

   Yes, we have a set of training courses listed [15]here. If you
   want to learn Jmix individually, contact [16]the training
   center to connect to a Group Training. If you have a complete
   developer’s team to start learning Jmix, please contact [17]the
   community manager to book the Team Training.

   SLA. We provide flexible [23]Enterprise Support Agreements.
   (BUTTON) What can I do for free?

     [23] https://www.haulmont.com/services/cuba-platform-services/support/#get-in-touch

   The Free plan has everything to build fully functional
   applications with Jmix. However, it lacks productivity features
   and advanced Add-ons of commercial tiers. Thus, we recommend
   using the free plan in two cases. First: you finished active
   development and the project is at support stage with occasional
   changes. Second: you've got a mature skillset in Java and you
   are ready to spend more time on development and learning. You
   can find a detailed comparison of the Jmix subscription plans
   [24]here.
   (BUTTON) What is the type of Jmix license: concurrent or named?

   Jmix license is named. It is connected to a certain developer
   profile.
   (BUTTON) Can I use my Jmix license on several workstations?

   Yes. You can work with the Jmix Studio from multiple
   workstations using your named license, but not in parallel.
   (BUTTON) What happens when my subscription is about to expire
   or has expired?

   If you have monthly or annual subscription auto-renewal
   enabled, we will:
     * automatically send you an email before the expiration date;
     * try to charge for the next subscription period according to
       your Jmix subscription payment terms;
     * if the payment succeeds, automatically renew the active
       subscription.

   You can switch off the autorenewal option in your profile.
   After subscription expiration, your Jmix Studio instance will
   automatically toggle to the Free plan mode.
   (BUTTON) What if I decide to abandon the subscription before
   the expiry date?

   We hope that you take the decision about the purchase
   carefully. That’s why we provide a trial period. The license
   fee is not refundable, so buy the subscription when you are
   sure you need it and will definitely use it. If you are not
   sure yet, you can always ask the [25]community manager to
   prolong your trial period.
   (BUTTON) How many license keys do I need?

     [25] https://www.jmix.io/contacts/

   Each developer needs a named license, so you would need to use
   as many license keys as many developers you want to involve.
   (BUTTON) Can I add more developers to my subscription?

   Yes. You can add additional developer seats to your active
   subscription in your [26]personal account by clicking the
   [27]“Manage” button.
   (BUTTON) Can I perform the upgrade of my subscription plan?

     [26] https://www.jmix.io/store/#/profile/
     [27] https://jmix.io/store/#/store/studio

   Yes, you can switch to a different plan on your subscription
   page.
   (BUTTON) I’m a student/teacher. Are there any educational
   licenses available?

   Yes. We provide free Academic licenses to official educational
   organizations and their students. Follow [28]the link to submit
   a request for an Academic license.
   (BUTTON) Does the number of end users affect Jmix license fees?

     [28] https://www.jmix.io/store/#/store/studio

   No. You pay only for developer seats, using Jmix paid
   subscription plans. We charge for visual tools, templates and
   add-ons that make your development team more productive and
   give the ability to deliver digital products faster. Instead of
   user-based pricing (runtime pricing) and usage-based pricing
   (connected to business value), we offer a per-developer
   subscription pricing model. This guarantees you the freedom to
   use your Jmix applications freely without restrictions.
   (BUTTON) What type of payments do you support?

   We support card payments and wire transfer. You can perform the
   payment using the [29]Store. If you would like to get a
   pro-forma invoice before payment, please choose “Offline
   payment” option.
   (BUTTON) Company or Individual?

     [29] https://www.jmix.io/store/#/store/

   A Company license is the standard licensing option for
   commercial and non-profit organizations. Company purchases
   licenses to be used by any single person within this
   organization.

   An Individual license is an option for private individuals who
   purchase a license with their own funds and solely for their
   own use. Individual licenses are not to be purchased, refunded
   or in any way financed by companies. Please consider that we
   will regularly check the usage conditions to prevent fraud.
   (BUTTON) Do you have any volume discounts?

   Yes. We provide volume discounts for the Jmix Enterprise
   subscription plan and higher. The volume discount depends on
   the number of developer seats purchased – the bigger your team,
   the less you pay.
   Number of developers Volume discount
   5 or more            10%
   10 or more           15%
   20 or more           20%
   30 or more           25%

   Please check the subscription prices for your team in the
   [30]Store.
   (BUTTON) Can I purchase a monthly subscription for the paid
   plans?

     [30] https://www.jmix.io/store/#/store/studio

   Yes, you can purchase a monthly subscription for Jmix RAD plan.
   For the Jmix Enterprise plan, annual subscription is the only
   option.
   (BUTTON) What types of applications can I develop with Jmix?

   You can develop a broad spectrum of line-of-business web
   applications. Please check [31]Is Jmix right for my project? to
   find details.
   (BUTTON) What is the difference between the plans?

     [31] https://www.jmix.io/is-jmix-right-for-my-project/

   Development teams are different by their professional skillset,
   project specification and DevOps practices. Thus, we have
   different subscription plans to serve various application
   development profiles:
     * Jmix Free plan is optimum for low budget development and
       supporting of existing application
     * Jmix RAD plan perfectly suits the projects of building web
       CRUD applications and various Systems of Records.
     * Jmix Enterprise plan brings extended capabilities to the
       previous plan to enable business process and workflows
       automation, integration with Maps and other premium
       application components.

   All subscription plans support distributed development teams
   with the built-in IntelliJ IDEA capabilities. Please check the
   [32]Jmix plans comparison table for details.
   (BUTTON) Can I perform upgrades if the active plan features
   won’t be enough?

   Sure. Anytime you meet the demand for features available on the
   higher subscription plans, you should change your plan or add
   users to your subscription at the profile. Please consider that
   we will charge only the difference in the price between
   subscription plans.
   (BUTTON) Where will be my data stored?

   There are several options. You can store the data in your
   self-hosted environment or a public cloud infrastructure. Check
   [33]the technical documentation for details.
   (BUTTON) Is Jmix secure enough to build enterprise-grade
   applications?

     [33] https://docs.jmix.io/

   Some skeptics claim that open source is less secure than
   proprietary software. But it’s just a theoretical assumption.
   The key benefit of the open-source code is its potential to be
   revised by far greater “number of eyes” than a closed effort of
   a product team. Full access to the application code can prevent
   sudden failure by deep code inspection as there is nothing
   hidden in the “black box”.

   Since 2016 the CUBA Platform is being developed as an
   open-source project. The platform team has continuously
   published a transparent product roadmap and regularly managed
   issue tracking on the public GitHub repository. Jmix platform,
   as the successor of the CUBA Platform, represents a mature
   open-source project based on a future-proof technology stack.

   The platform maturity doesn’t exclude all security risks, so
   governance procedures are mandatory. But a strong community
   with over 25K members and more than 1000 projects done with the
   platform assure a strong basis for building secure
   applications.
   (BUTTON) Does Jmix support secure user authentication?

   Yes. There are several options. In addition to the standard
   user-password authentication, you can connect Jmix application
   to the enterprise LDAP directory and synchronize end-user
   accounts. For secure external connections via API endpoint,
   Jmix provides OAuth 2.0 authentication service.
   (BUTTON) Should I pay for distributing the Apps created by
   Jmix?

   No. You completely own the applications built with Jmix and can
   use them at any scale without any charges.
   (BUTTON) Do I own applications built with Jmix?

   Yes. As Jmix is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license, it
   does not imply any substantial limitations on applications.
   Jmix Studio is only used at development time and is not
   required to run your application.
   (BUTTON) Does Jmix use third party libraries? Where can I see
   the full list and how are these licensed?

   The full list of libraries, used by the latest Jmix and Add-ons
   releases, is provided [34]here. The list of libraries, used in
   Jmix Studio, is available [35]here.

     [34] https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/dep-ver.html
     [35] https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/dep-ver.html

   All libraries we are using are distributed under open source,
   non-restrictive licenses - like MIT, Apache 2.0, EPL, LGPL. We
   do not use libraries with ‘copyleft’ licenses like GPL.

   Note: Add-ons provide integration with some products, which may
   have commercial license - like Google Maps or amCharts. It is
   your responsibility to make sure you use them properly.

   All forks of third-party libraries, used in Jmix, Add-ons and
   Studio are distributed under the same license terms as the
   corresponding library.
