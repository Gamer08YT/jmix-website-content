   TAB Bank gains internal process excellence to reduce costs
   while expanding the business
     * x20 productivity boost in loan application processing
     * Up to 20% operational staff time saving
     * Eliminated siloed spreadsheets

The Story

   Since 1998, TAB Bank has provided business finance solutions to
   clients across the USA. The company initially specialized in
   financial services for truckers at truck stops. After over 20
   years, the Utah-based bank diversified the product portfolio to
   include online banking services to expand the customer base on
   small and medium enterprises (SMEs) primarily across the United
   States. In 2016, the TAB Bank IT department started to search
   for an enterprise application development technology to enable
   continuous online business growth. The technology should
   fulfill strict regulation requirements for banking software in
   the US and rapid application development functionality to
   perform internal digitalization projects.

The Challenge

   One of the major blockers that slowed down the digital
   transformation journey's pace was the loan and deposit
   processing workflow automation. Previously, TAB bank used a CRM
   system to manage inbound loan applications. The given approach
   proved to limit the business as it was unable to tailor the
   solution to the specific requirements of automated loan
   application processing: customer data was siloed across
   disparate systems; staff made a lot of manual steps during the
   workflow execution. Given the expansive customer base, TAB Bank
   needed to implement the end-to-end loan applications process
   automation starting from the inquiry made via TAB bank`s
   website and finishing with the approval/rejection and notifying
   the client. The TAB Bank team found Jmix (back then - CUBA
   Platform) functionality suitable for migrating the entire
   process into the custom workflow and making it as easy as
   possible for consumers and employees. The business objective
   was set time-sensitive as TAB Bank did not want to renew the
   incumbent CRM system for the next year and pay the associated
   licensing costs.

Solution

   The Haulmont development team, working with the TAB Bank team,
   delivered the custom solution on time to cut costs for the
   business. The new digital workflow of loan application
   processing showed greater efficiency as 70-80% of
   approval/rejections were automated. Following the success, TAB
   Bank developed a series of applications to enhance internal
   process excellence and increase productivity:
     * Risk management system. The new system eliminated
       spreadsheets usage and automated the risk management
       process. Now, TAB Bank management monitor the dashboard
       connected to key performance indicators. The dashboard
       automatically highlights the emerging risks when relative
       indicators drop below certain levels.
     * Credit checks. TAB Bank implemented an automated scoring
       system built with Jmix to perform credit checks for new
       loan applications. The scoring system leverages BPM
       capabilities to orchestrate requests to external services
       like Experian, PayNET, and internal scoring logic
       execution. Finally, the system calculates the credit rating
       and generates a reject or approval decision with
       recommendations.
     * Customer 360. TAB bank team has built with Jmix
       one-stop-shop for customer connected data: contacts,
       communication history, connections with other customers,
       overall status on all consumed products, balance, return on
       equity and loan grade calculation, transaction history with
       details. The system brought front-office and call center
       employees to get all data about the customer rapidly and
       navigate easily across the connected data and services.
     * Automatic payment recognition and reconciling. Jmix
       automated the admin-heavy factoring service with the
       digital workflow to reconcile payments, deduct funds under
       a factoring agreement and notify customers about invoice
       payments. As a result, TAB Bank has concentrated on
       business growth opportunities instead of business run
       issues.

Result

   The platform helped TAB Bank to automate a lot of laborious
   business processes and manual tasks. Loan applications
   processing time was reduced from two days to an hour on
   average. Process automation and data centralization stipulated
   up to 20% economy in specialists worktime. Thus, TAB Bank
   performs greater work without workforce capacity growth, and
   customers receive better service quality with the significant
   processing time reduction.
