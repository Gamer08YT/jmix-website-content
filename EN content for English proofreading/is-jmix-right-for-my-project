Is Jmix Right for My Project?

Line-of-Business Applications

   The mission of Jmix is to offer superior productivity and
   simplicity for developing Line-of-Business (LOB) web
   applications. These are applications, which run the business
   either on the company, divisional or departmental level.
   Examples represent a broad spectrum from spreadsheets to highly
   specialized custom systems classified as ERP, CRM, EAM, SCM,
   WMS, ECM, ERM, HRM.
   Typical LOB applications characteristics:
     * Non-trivial business logic or processes automation
     * Extensive data model
     * Uniform and functional UI, often hundreds of screens
     * Users are mostly company employees or partners

Team profile

   The unique feature of Jmix is the ability to use Java or trendy
   Kotlin both for backend and frontend development. The benefits
   of one language for the whole stack cannot be underestimated: a
   single developer can implement a complete feature from data
   storage to web interface, eliminating frictions between web and
   backend teams. Mono language coding with high-level API makes
   Jmix the easiest option to onboard developers with experience
   in other server side languages or obsolete technologies like
   FoxPro, Oracle Forms, MS Access, Lightswitch, Silverlight,
   Delphi.

When should I consider different options?

     * Like any platform, Jmix is not a silver bullet. You might
       want to consider alternatives when:
     * 03
       Custom UI design and web-scale are critical, and you are
       prepared to wait longer and pay extra for it. In this case,
       consider Jmix as a powerful backend with an advanced admin
       interface.
     * 01
       You have web-only or dedicated web and backend teams and
       established design-first or API-first development
       practices. Even if Jmix is a good match, you might want to
       stick to the already adopted development practices.
     * 04
       The project is already running. Jmix is intended for
       starting new projects and would rarely apply to those
       already well on the way to production.
     * 02
       The application uses most of its data from external sources
       or has a very basic data model.
     * 05
       You donâ€™t have access to professional developers; your
       project is a reasonably simple or standard application.
       Consider No Code or Low Code alternatives in those
       scenarios but bear in mind license fees and [9]limitations.
