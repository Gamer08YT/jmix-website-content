A robust open-source foundation for line-of-business (LOB)
applications

   Jmix Framework leverages the power of Spring – a de-facto
   standard in Java web applications development. Jmix developers
   can easily tap into its wide ecosystem and utilize their
   previous expertise. Spring core guarantees high scalability and
   support for any deployment options – from local to public
   clouds.

One language

   With Jmix, you can use just one language – Java or Kotlin to
   build the entire application. Mono language coding simplifies
   staffing, eliminates fragmented responsibility between front-
   and backend teams and boosts productivity. One developer can
   implement a complete feature from the data model and business
   logic to UI in a single IDE with superior debugging
   capabilities.

Powerful data manipulation features

   Line-of-business or LOB applications frequently rely on an
   extensive data model, with data stored in relational databases.
   Jmix framework provides support for:
     * Advanced visual components for data filtering, eliminating
       the need to hard code queries or their parameter
     * Transparent and efficient application of security
       constraints at data load throughout the whole application
     * Soft deletion, so you can restore any deleted entity and
       easily maintain data retention policies
     * Audit, enabling tracking all changes to the critical bits
       of data
     * Declarative definition of data graphs to be loaded

Fine-grained access control

   Large enterprise solutions introduce complex authorization
   requirements. The implementation may result in an unmanageable
   horde of "if" statements scattered around the code.

   Jmix security subsystem offers declarative configuration of
   access to:
     * icon
       Screen and menu items
     * icon
       Data model on entities and attributes level
     * icon
       Data matching certain criteria, e.g. documents belonging to
       a user’s department
     * icon
       Custom tokens for protecting specific bits of business
       logic

   With Jmix, a developer can configure advanced access control
   rules with minimal efforts and ensure their complete
   transparency.

Enterprise-grade web UI

   Jmix UI framework offers everything to deliver hundreds of
   modern-looking, functional and secured screens in record time:

Simple Integration with Anything

   Jmix offers seamless reuse of thousands of libraries and
   connectors to the most popular software from Spring and Java
   ecosystems.

   Generic REST and GraphQL API provide controlled access to your
   data for external applications, or you can easily expose custom
   endpoints to offer tailored API.
