   In 2019, our team started working on a project for the Brunei
   government. The system required a user-friendly interface. We
   didnâ€™t have much experience in building web UI. So, we searched
   for a development environment that provided out-of-the-box
   features for building UIs with in-built security and
   compatibility with previous database structures. And found the
   CUBA Platform (now Jmix), a perfect fit for our project. The
   solution was launched in February 2020.
