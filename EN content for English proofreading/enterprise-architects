Secure business resilience with applications
you build fast and entirely control

Deliver line-of-business applications in record time

   Jmix data-centric approach and enterprise-grade UI components
   facilitate record-time development or modernization of LOB
   applications with an extensive data model. Open architecture
   simplifies integrations and makes Jmix an excellent backend
   option for customer-facing applications with advanced
   administrative UI.

Stay in control

   Jmix is built around an open-source framework leveraging Spring
   Boot features. This guarantees full control over the source
   code of your applications and that any of 8+ million Java
   developers worldwide can support them. Jmix public
   infrastructure includes active community forum, extensive
   documentation and learning materials, so your team would hardly
   hit a wall.

Keep your developers happy 

   Typical Low Code platforms aim to engage ‘citizen developers’,
   offering a high level of abstraction and purely visual
   development. Jmix advocates for a different approach,
   empowering professional developers with productive tools and
   API, retaining the pleasure of coding in a familiar
   environment.

   Depending on the project lifecycle, Jmix boosts the development
   several times compared to custom open-source stack development.
   This is achieved by the platform’s main features: a greatly
   elaborated “enterprise core” and modularization.

   By the enterprise core we mean:
     * Data model based on entities (objects)
     * Role based access control
     * Session management and scalability

   And by modularization we mean Studio features (development
   speed up and unification of development approaches) and modules
   reuse (not just code snippets, but full-fledged modules with
   internal business-logic and a common core).
