   Ingenico connects Jira with the legacy project management
   system by the Pipe in 3 months
     * 3 months
     * Single entry point for all project data
     * Improved traceability with easy reporting

The Story

   Ingenico has been leading in the payment industry for over 30
   years, serving customers across various industries. In October
   2020, the company joined Wordline growing from 8 000 to 20 000
   employees. Scaling pushed forward the requirements for the IT
   department services. The team decided to improve their internal
   task management system, facing problems with the siloed
   processes and data between the Jira system and the legacy
   project management Sciforma solution. Thus, users had to move
   back and forth between the two systems with different
   environment types: a modern but unstructured Jira interface and
   an old-fashioned but battle-proven Sciforma screens.

The Challenge

   The Ingenico team decided to integrate parts of the
   Sciforma-based system with Jira. They`ve assigned the project
   objectives:
     * automate tasks in Sciforma (such as the projects progress
       validation, already made in Jira) leveraging the external
       software to improve the control over processes;
     * transfer the timesheet data from Jira to Sciforma using the
       REST API of Jira to get the time-tracking entries, build
       data repository, list of users, list of projects, etc.;
     * get the list of time spent (or user activities) from
       timesheets monthly;
     * perform the data quality layer with corresponding task
       checking and raise necessary alerts for cases where a
       business task is not compliant with Sciforma and Jira.

   Time limits and process resilience requirements looked
   challengeable. The integration system should be compliant with
   Jira and perform sustainable data transfer from Sciforma to
   SAP. All of that in three months.

Solution

   The project team inspected the market to find a robust web
   application development platform and chose CUBA Platform (now
   Jmix). They've decided to start with the time tracking data
   transfer from Jira towards the Sciforma`s project tree. Jmix
   Studio capabilities and ready-to-use add-ons enabled the
   interconnection within the time frame. Further, the team
   switched to the reporting system as the Jira reporting system
   looked too complicated for non-technical specialists like sales
   and marketing. The platform with the Charts add-on proved to be
   an excellent tool for extracting data from Jira and building
   reports to manage R&D activities and project delivery progress.

Result

   The platform helped Ingenico to save time and match the
   business expectations. Jmix (ex-CUBA) Studio capabilities
   abstracted the team from web development challenges and let
   them concentrate on the business objectives and end-users
   needs. The integrated task management system was called the
   Pipe - it perfectly describes the core functionality. The Pipe
   provides the data flow between Jira and Sciforma, bringing the
   single entry point to manage project time and resources in a
   user-friendly way.
