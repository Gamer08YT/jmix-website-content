Jmix and CUBA developers
never get stuck

   We provide support right from the project launch to
   post-production.

We offer three support levels

   depending on project phase, time constraints and budget

Free Support

   All Jmix developers are backed by a free forum and there is
   ample knowledge there already. We always try to answer each new
   question quickly but the speed heavily depends on staff
   availability and difficulty of the question. Many questions are
   also answered by fellow community members.

   consultancy requests receive priority over forum questions.
