Discover visual, data-centric development experience combined with
the world’s most powerful code editing capabilities of IntelliJ
Platform.

   In Jmix Studio, developers can choose to work directly with
   code or use visual editors, switching between representations
   at any time as they see fit. A combination of options ensures
   transparency and simplifies debugging.

   tools dramatically boost developer productivity and facilitate
   fast learning.
