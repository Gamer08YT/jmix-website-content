Empower line-of-business applications
with BPM capabilities

   Processes play a crucial role in most organizations. Digitizing
   them is essential to boost efficiency and improve business
   outcomes.
   Popular business process management (BPM) tools enable fast
   implementation of digital processes, often with zero coding.
   But integrating them into your IT landscape may prove
   challenging. Building digital workflows into line-of-business
   applications streamlines user experience and helps to break
   down data silos.
