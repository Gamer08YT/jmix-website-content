   Varasset Migrates from Legacy to Modern Open-source Stack in 8
   Months
     * 8 months
     * Complete system migration
     * Utility software market leader

The Story

   Several years ago Microsoft announced the MS Silverlight end of
   life. Varasset, who developed their utility management system
   on Silverlight, had to find another platform. The migration
   could take lots of time and effort.

   During the research Varasset found CUBA Platform (currently
   named Jmix). It provided everything they needed: a modern
   open-source stack, learning materials and documentation for
   easy start, out-of-the-box functionality which met their needs.

   The migration took much less time and work than the Varasset
   team expected. They adopted Java stack and completed the
   process in just 8 months. The migration was performed by 5-6
   developers working part-time.

   Now Varasset supports their products with CUBA. The in-built
   features like business process management allows the team to
   configure the product possibilities according to the specific
   customers’ needs.

The Product

   Varasset is a configurable software solution for the power and
   communications industries. It specializes in targeted work and
   asset management processes for power distribution and
   transmission, adapting to the unique needs of each
   organization. Along with other features, Varasset manages and
   maintains capital projects’ processes and assets, tracking the
   project costs and progress.

   Varasset has a long history of success on the US market. The
   team works on two products: “Varasset XAM” and “Varasset Joint
   Use”. Initially, their development was based on Microsoft
   Silverlight. After Microsoft announced the platform sunset, the
   team had to find another tool, more flexible and open-source.
   After a long research, they chose Jmix (back then - CUBA
   Platform).

Solution

   The big task for Varasset was the migration from MS
   Silverlight. It was achieved with less effort than the team
   expected. The migration took about 8 months and was performed
   by a team of 5-6 developers, some of them working part-time.

It was surprisingly easy to transition from the Microsoft
technologies to the Java stack.

     Dave Chaney, Varasset Managing Partner

   Currently, all application functionality of Varasset products
   is developed and supported with the help of CUBA. Varasset
   manages and maintains capital projects’ processes and assets,
   tracking the project costs and progress. The latest versions of
   the system have the following features:
     * Organizing the crews - analyzing the types of expertise,
       equipment, and the correspondent work, assigning crews for
       the objects and tasks based on this analysis;
     * Dynamic assignment of workflow user tasks;
     * Displaying work objects on the map;
     * Work scheduling;
     * Built-in messenger with notifications;
     * Managing the internal data - customers info, agreements and
       other documents.

   The out-of-the-box platform components, such as emailing,
   reports generation, single sign-on helped to save much money
   and time. The team configures fairly complex workflows for the
   customers’ needs, and the platform’s in-built features such as
   the BPM module allow Varasset to adapt to the unique work
   processes of each customer.

Result

   Jmix (ex-CUBA Platform) enabled the Varasset team to migrate
   from Silverlight to a contemporary technology stack quickly and
   easily. Built-in BPM functionality allowed the team to
   configure specific workflows according to the customers’
   individual requirements.

   Today Varasset is a leading asset and work management tool for
   utilities and is used by the biggest electric utilities, cable,
   and telecommunication companies in the US.
