       Summary

Enabling digital transformation in the insurance industry

   The evolution of the insurance industry is driven by adopting
   and leveraging automation. Technology can be used to automate
   laborious, manual business processes which are outdated,
   inefficient and prone to human error. Businesses that don’t
   adopt automation will be left behind the competition in terms
   of efficiency, operational agility, the customer experience and
   ultimately, profitability.

   The more routine business processes that a company can
   automate, the bigger the customer service advantage the company
   has over a competitor which has not leveraged technology and
   automation. Insurance automation or as it is known, ‘Insurtech’
   is driven by the desire to streamline, reduce costs for both
   businesses and customers through greater efficiency and improve
   the customer experience. Automation is being routinely adopted
   across marketing, sales and renewals business units by
   forward-thinking, technology-led insurance companies.

Benefits of using automation
in the insurance industry

   It is clear that as innovative insurance companies begin
   adopting technology-led processes, the insurance industry faces
   disruption. Customers demand a new seamless customer experience
   which is driven by “anytime and anywhere” digital-first
   business that is seen in other industries.

   By embracing technology and automation, insurance companies can
   improve operations and build stronger relationships with
   customers. Expected outcomes of automation include:
   [ba8aab.svg]

Improvements to risk management

   Automation can help insurers to improve risk management. By
   using advanced technologies, businesses can pivot towards using
   data and analytics to manage risk through predictions and
   prevention.

   Automation is already common in risk profiling for Insurtech
   companies but there is scope for the industry to expand this
   data profiling to support the automation of processes such as
   underwriting.

Impact on employment and reducing human error

   The human factor that is present in all manual processes is a
   source of huge risk for the insurance industry; a relatively
   simple mistake could cost financial and reputational loss. With
   this in mind, the potential for automation to digitize business
   processes and eliminate the risk of human error can’t be
   overstated.

   Industry pioneers are already using automation in customizable
   insurance CRM softwares to manage customers in both a more
   time-efficient and accurate manner. This kind of technology
   adoption reduces risk and reduces manual processes so staff
   have more time to spend on valuable tasks which can enhance and
   grow the business.

Reducing negative outcomes of legacy systems and IT Debt

   Many insurance companies use legacy systems to support core
   business operations. The use of older and outdated tech is
   often due to cost and the difficulty of implementing wide-scale
   change and securing ‘buy-in’ from stakeholders.

   The problem with this approach is that as the industry evolves
   and customer expectations change, legacy systems often no
   longer meet functional requirements. As a result, companies add
   additional operational systems that perform in silos and
   management don’t have a 360 view of the business. According to
   Deloitte, insurers can have up to 26 applications in their
   policy administration environments with an average of four
   policy administration systems in their ecosystem. The majority
   of these systems are either custom developed or outdated
   applications from insurance software vendors.
   [aaa802.svg]

   Innovative, digital-first business leaders should consider a
   modern modular application which can be configured and
   customized to their business needs. This is an approach known
   as ‘Composable Enterprise’. The concept of composability is
   based on: business architecture, mindset and technology.
   Businesses use modular technologies to break components or
   different business areas into smaller microservices which
   allows for greater agility and faster response times.

Ability to respond to changing regulation and compliance requirements

   Companies that continue using outdated, legacy systems can face
   issues with compliance which is particularly important in
   regulated industries such as insurance. One example is GDPR
   legislation which was implemented a few years ago. This
   legislation has required the industry to update certain
   business processes and it is an issue that some businesses
   continue to struggle to comply with.

   In additional to legislative changes, the industry must also
   ensure that it can meet compliance requirements remotely. As
   more people work from home and more consumers expect to be able
   to access products online, insurers must adapt and embrace
   digital transformation. For example, eSignatures and digital
   forms are becoming normalized and now applicable for many
   official documents in many countries.
   [eb8e15.svg]

   Insurers that maintain the competitive edge will be those that
   offer services remotely so it is essential that these can be
   integrated seamlessly and compliantly into existing systems.
   Businesses need to react quickly and integrate new technology
   as soon as a new opportunity arises, bridging the gap between
   complex infrastructure and new technology that enables a good
   customer experience in line with good governance.

Improving and personalizing the customer experience

   Inefficient methods of claims handling, duplicated systems,
   complicated workflows and outdated core legacy systems are
   leading to slow response times and outdated data within the
   insurance industry. Using automation and data insights, the
   insurance industry can vastly improve the customer experience
   through faster response times.

   There is a huge amount of data stored in legacy systems coupled
   with pressure from regulation/compliance that means a full
   replacement of legacy systems is not always feasible or even
   recommended. However, there is a solution. Judging by our
   customers’ requests and feedback, the industry is searching for
   an agile and iterative approach to modernization.
   [5a380c.svg]

   Companies need both the right strategy and technology to
   improve operations and the customer experience overall.
   Automation in the insurance industry is vital to this progress.
   Tech leaders, Gartner, recommend the aforementioned ‘Composable
   Enterprise’ on low-code (or so-called less code) platforms.

   Composable business is made of Packaged business capabilities
   (PBCs). Lightweight application building blocks provide
   functionality for specific business needs without unnecessary
   dependencies. PBCs are decentralized, isolated and ready to be
   deployed immediately. They are portable and interoperable
   meaning they can be enterprise system add-ons or standalone
   solutions for insurance. If combined, they form a new ecosystem
   that is reusable, agile and resilient.

Technology platforms to enable automation in the industry

   The idea of composability is a fundamental part of the low-code
   application development model and addresses a core challenge:
   developing packaged business capabilities that have minimal
   costs, are quick to deploy and easy to maintain.

   Looking at the broader insurance industry landscape, the role
   of technology is becoming more important. Typically, insurers
   work with a number of external partners to deliver a product
   and therefore need to be able to provide a fully digital
   experience to customers built on connections between
   organizations.
   [ba516a.svg]

   Low-code technologies are mature enough to handle large scale
   projects such as system re-platforms but CTOs and IT leaders
   need to carefully consider the right platform to adopt to drive
   automation in the insurance industry. It is important to
   consider existing in-house developer skillsets and business
   scope limitations as a result of existing CRM and BPM
   solutions.

   Low-code platforms allow developers to efficiently automate
   routine process and therefore free up time for writing valuable
   code for business-specific operations. Tech teams can benefit
   from a solution that dramatically speeds up testing and
   deployment times as well as tech that allows inexperienced
   developers to become productive in the short-term. Any
   companies that want to improve developer productivity within
   their own tech teams, train entry-level programmers and deliver
   new applications in a quick timeframe will benefit from
   low-code solutions.
