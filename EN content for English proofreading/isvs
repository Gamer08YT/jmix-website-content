Create or renovate your digital product fast
with zero penalties

Fast prototyping

   Testing your idea and getting fast user feedback is crucial for
   a high-quality digital product. Jmix brings the highest
   productivity boost at the initial stage of the project, helping
   to deliver MVPs in days instead of weeks.

No scaling penalties

   Jmix is licensed per developer and does not lock you into
   proprietary infrastructure. You get absolutely no charges for
   scaling your customer base. Open-sourced framework guarantees
   your product is entirely under your control.

Low development and maintenance costs

   For an ISV, product development and further maintenance are
   dominating costs. Jmix not only dramatically cuts development
   efforts but also does the heavy lifting of the technology stack
   upgrades, helping to keep your product modern and secure.

   We configure fairly complex workflows for the customersâ€™ needs,
   and Jmix in-built features such as the BPM module allow us to
   adapt to the unique work processes of each customer.
