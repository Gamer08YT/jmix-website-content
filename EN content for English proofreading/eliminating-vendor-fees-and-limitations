Eliminating Vendor Fees and Limitations

Replace expensive vendor solutions with applications you own and
control

   Typical Low Code and BPMS Platforms offer very low barriers to
   entry as well as extremely fast and free development. This
   makes them so tempting to choose for your next project. But
   when it’s time to rollout, you may face the other side of LCAP
   or BPMS: high fees tied to the number of users and consumed
   resources and complicated customization of anything beyond
   standard platform capabilities.
   Sometimes you find yourself in a similar situation with SaaS
   products. When they work, they work great, but sometimes the
   “value for money” just isn’t right, or you get stuck with the
   limits of what can be customized. As a result, 29% of midsize
   enterprises reported in the Gartner survey that between 25% and
   49% of the subscriptions with their top three SaaS vendors are
   currently idle.

The obvious way to overcome those challenges is migration to a custom
developed solution. In this scenario, Jmix provides an efficient
alternative to classic development
