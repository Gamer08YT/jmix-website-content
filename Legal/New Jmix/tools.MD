# Discover visual, data centric development experience combined with the worldâ€™s most powerful code editing capabilities of IntelliJ Platform.

In Jmix Studio, developers can choose to work directly with code or use visual editors, switching between representations at any time as they see fit. A combination of options ensures transparency and simplifies debugging.

Visual designers, code generators and deployment automation tools dramatically boost developer productivity and facilitate fast learning.

## Design Visually

Data model
Screens
Business Processes

### Generate Code

1. DDL and DB migration scripts
2. UI screens from templates
3. Services, listeners, event handlers
4. Data model or a complete CRUD app over an existing database

### Write Code
Jmix Studio enhances IntelliJ IDE with specific code navigation, refactoring, injections, smart hints and quick fixes.

As IntelliJ is an open platform, you may complement Jmix tools with any of hundreds of available 3rd party plugins. For example, Tabnine or GitHub Copilot plugins offer unrivalled AI-assisted development capabilities.
