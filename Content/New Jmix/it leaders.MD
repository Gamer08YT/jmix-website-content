In 2019, our team started working on a project for the Brunei government. The system required a user-friendly interface. We didnâ€™t have much experience in building web UI. So, we searched for a development environment that provided out-of-the-box features for building UIs with in-built security and compatibility with previous database structures. And found the CUBA Platform (now Jmix), a perfect fit for our project. The solution was launched in February 2020.
