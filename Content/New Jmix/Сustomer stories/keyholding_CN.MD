## The Story
## 故事起源

The Keyholding Company is a security services and alarm response business. In 2013, the Keyholding CEO Charlie Gordon Lennox approached Haulmont to partner him in supporting a digital transformation of his company. The aim was to create an enterprise IT system for automating routine tasks of the security services and alarm response business. The system should help to raise the service level, cut the alarm signal response time and ensure the performance of all instructions for each object (building).
Keyholding 公司是一家安全服务和警报响应公司。2013年，Keyholding 首席执行官 Charlie Gordon Lennox 与 Haulmont 接洽，希望双方合作支持其公司的数字化转型。其目的是创建一个企业 IT 系统，将安全服务和警报响应业务的日常任务进行自动化。系统应有助于提高服务水平，缩短报警信号的响应时间，并确保对每个物体（建筑物）全部指令的及时发送性能。

An initial pilot project delivered a proof-of-concept solution comprising enterprise-spec controller screens managing a highly custom mobile workforce app. Thanks to Jmix (ex-CUBA Platform) abilities the pilot was completed just in 3 months, and the full-scale solution, called Chase, was delivered in 2 years.
最初的试点项目中，部署了一个概念验证解决方案，该解决方案中，实现通过企业特定的控制界面管理高度定制的人力 App。由于 Jmix（之前为 CUBA 平台）的强大能力，该试点仅在 3 个月内完成，而名为 Chase 的整体解决方案在 2 年内交付。

Thanks to the success of Chase, combined with The Keyholding Company’s vision and ambition, the company became recognized as the most technologically advanced security and alarm response vendor. The system also enabled the company to open a new horizon in its business area and ensured further business evolution and expansion.
由于 Chase 的成功，加上 Keyholding 公司的愿景和雄心壮志，该公司被公认为技术最先进的安全和警报响应供应商。该系统还使公司在其业务领域开辟了新的视野，并确保了进一步的业务发展和扩张。

## The Way to Success
## 成功之路

Initially, the pilot version was integrated with Keyholding’s legacy platform. The success of this project was evident not just in the board approving a full systems replacement project but also in the fact that the pilot solution itself was rolled out to national partners to deliver immediate value to the business whilst the Haulmont team prepared the full-scale version.
最初，试点版本与 Keyholding 的旧平台进行集成。董事会批准将整个系统完全替换，由 Haulmont 团队准备整体解决方案。随后，试点方案也推广到国家合作伙伴，并直接提升了业务价值。这些因素促成了项目的成功。

Continually developed by an integrated team of The Keyholding Company’s Tech and Ops staff working with Haulmont developers, Chase now runs all aspects of the company’s operations, alongside powerful best-in-class third party solutions for CRM, call center and business intelligence.
随着 Keyholding 公司的技术和运营人员以及 Haulmont 的开发人员组成的合作团队持续开发，Chase 现在已经支持公司运营的各个方面，以及作为 CRM、呼叫中心和 BI 的首选第三方解决方案。

## Result
## 结果

The Keyholding Company is now recognized as the most technologically advanced company in its field. Across the UK, 2 000 operatives use the company’s mobile app to complete over 45 000 jobs per month whilst maintaining a quality of service that is accredited as in the top 5% of all security companies.
Keyholding 公司现在是该领域公认技术最先进的公司。在英国各地，有 2000 名工作人员使用该公司的移动 App 每月完成超过 45000 个任务，同时保持在所有安全公司中排名前 5% 的服务质量。

Performance in alarm response is a key metric for the business. Since Chase went live, average processing time for booking an alarm response has been reduced from 5-8 minutes to under a minute, with over a third of all bookings processed with no human involvement at all.
警报响应是否及时是业务的关键指标。自 Chase 上线以来，预订警报响应的平均处理时间已从 5-8 分钟减少到不到 1 分钟，并且有超过三分之一的预订在无人参与的情况下自动处理。

By restructuring their business around a ‘Digital-First’ philosophy, with Chase at the core, The Keyholding Company has not only delivered efficiency and a platform for scale, but also an unparalleled service offering for clients, thanks to their ability to manage customer service and reporting. The company now has a significant data engineering unit to capitalize on the huge amount of data generated by Chase and its third-party integrations, enabling The Keyholding Company to offer MI reporting to clients and a level of regulatory compliance, audit history and commercial SLAs that are far in advance of their competition.
通过贯彻“数字优先”的理念对业务进行重组，以 Chase 为核心系统，Keyholding 公司不仅部署了效率和规模平台，而且由于他们管理客户和报表的能力，还为客户提供了更加优质的服务。该公司现在拥有一个重要的数据工程部门，利用 Chase 和集成的第三方软件生成的大量数据，使 Keyholding 公司能够为客户提供 MI 报表以及一定程度的合规性、审计历史和业务 SLA，这些都远远领先于竞争对手。

The company is now exploiting new markets. It no longer focuses solely on private residence alarm response, but has expanded to managing security for huge multi-site businesses, leveraging their investment in a highly scalable technology platform to deliver high levels of customer service to multiple corporate customers with over 7 000 sites nationwide.
该公司现在正在开拓新的市场。不再仅仅关注私人住宅警报响应，而是扩展到管理大型多分支企业的安全性，利用其在高度可扩展的技术平台上的投资，为全国 7000 多个分支的多个企业客户提供高水平的客户服务。
