## The Story 

Ingenico has been leading in the payment industry for over 30 years, serving customers across various industries. In October 2020, the company joined Wordline growing from 8 000 to 20 000 employees. Scaling pushed forward the requirements for the IT department services. The team decided to improve their internal task management system, facing problems with the siloed processes and data between the Jira system and the legacy project management Sciforma solution. Thus, users had to move back and forth between the two systems with different environment types: a modern but unstructured Jira interface and an old-fashioned but battle-proven Sciforma screens. 

## The Challenge 

The Ingenico team decided to integrate parts of the Sciforma-based system with Jira. They`ve assigned the project objectives: 

- automate tasks in Sciforma (such as the projects progress validation, already made in Jira) leveraging the external software to improve the control over processes; 

- transfer the timesheet data from Jira to Sciforma using the REST API of Jira to get the time-tracking entries, build data repository, list of users, list of projects, etc.; 

- get the list of time spent (or user activities) from timesheets monthly; 

- perform the data quality layer with corresponding task checking and raise necessary alerts for cases where a business task is not compliant with Sciforma and Jira. 

Time limits and process resilience requirements looked challengeable. The integration system should be compliant with Jira and perform sustainable data transfer from Sciforma to SAP. All of that in three months. 

## Solution 

The project team inspected the market to find a robust web application development platform and chose CUBA Platform (now Jmix). They've decided to start with the time tracking data transfer from Jira towards the Sciforma`s project tree. Jmix Studio capabilities and ready-to-use add-ons enabled the interconnection within the time frame. Further, the team switched to the reporting system as the Jira reporting system looked too complicated for non-technical specialists like sales and marketing. The platform with the Charts add-on proved to be an excellent tool for extracting data from Jira and building reports to manage R&D activities and project delivery progress. 

## Result

The platform helped Ingenico to save time and match the business expectations. Jmix (ex-CUBA) Studio capabilities abstracted the team from web development challenges and let them concentrate on the business objectives and end-users needs. The integrated task management system was called the Pipe - it perfectly describes the core functionality. The Pipe provides the data flow between Jira and Sciforma, bringing the single entry point to manage project time and resources in a user-friendly way.
