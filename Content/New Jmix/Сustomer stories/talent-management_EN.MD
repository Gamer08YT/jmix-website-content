## The Story 

UCO is an IT consulting and software development company active in Kazakhstan. One of the professional areas they cover is HR management systems. One of UCO’s customers required a new HR system that would manage recruiting, training, career development and other crucial processes. 

Following the client’s needs, UCO was looking for a way to deliver a functional enterprise-level HR management system. 

Since existing products did not fit into the customer requirements for multiple reasons, the team decided to develop the system from scratch using Jmix (formerly known as CUBA Platform). A PoC on Jmix was approved, and the full-scale system was delivered in the shortest time possible. 

## Extending the Success 

The system was built on Jmix by a small team of 3 developers in just 6,5 months and is now used to track careers of 65000 employees in several companies. Specially created for large corporations, the system allows managing all processes related to staff hiring, educating, motivating, and promoting. 

The first intention was to save time at the Proof of Concept stage. After the PoC was approved, UCO fully relied on Jmix and Premium Add-ons to deliver a fully functional system, featuring the following modules: 

- Multi-Recruiting 

- KPI-based Goal Setting and Control 

- Competence Matching 

- Points of Professional Growth 

- Certification 

- Learning Management 

- Foreign Language Courses 

- Personal Career Development 

- Regular Testing 

In a year after the system implementation, UCO launched the product internationally under the SaaS model.
