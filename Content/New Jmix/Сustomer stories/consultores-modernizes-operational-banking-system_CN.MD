该公司的传统技术已经过时，因此他们面临着南美市场缺乏开发者的问题。在现代化日趋紧要的关头，公司开始为他们的下一个产品版本研究新技术框架和应用。随着业务的增长，他们需要一种简单的方法来加快开发速度。


#### Why IT Consultores Chose Jmix 
#### IT Consultores 为什么选择 Jmix 

Research led the company to approach Jmix regarding its Jmix platform, a framework for rapid enterprise development. Jmix hasn't limitations that have low code platforms but also allows it to speed up app development. In Jmix you pay for developer seats, not for user fees, and this has a huge benefit for business with a lot of customers such as banks. 
经过调研，该公司与 Jmix 团队进行了接触，Jmix 平台是快速企业开发框架。Jmix 没有低代码平台的限制，并能加快应用程序开发。在 Jmix 中，仅需为开发人员席位付费，而不是为用户付费，这对于拥有银行等大量客户的企业来说具有非常大的吸引力。

By rebuilding the core system’s architecture and UI using Jmix, the new solution could be scaled easily and customized to support individual client requirements, while decreasing speed and cost of development significantly. 
通过使用 Jmix 重建核心系统的体系架构和 UI，新的解决方案可以轻松扩展和定制以支持每个客户的需求，同时显著提升开发速度和降低开发成本。

## How Jmix responded  
## Jmix 如何支持

The project team at IT Consultores worked in partnership with Jmix’s custom solutions team to migrate the company’s existing banking software solutions to Jmix. 
IT Consultores 的项目团队与 Jmix 的定制解决方案团队合作，将公司现有的银行软件迁移到 Jmix。

The new solution, “Finera”, is designed to fulfil the operational needs of the banking sector through a more intuitive and user-friendly solution. We have replaced complicated screens displaying lots of data with workflows which guide users through processes to reduce the risks of human error. 
新的 “Finera” 系统旨在通过更直观和友好的解决方案满足银行业的运营需求。我们已经用工作流替换了显示大量数据的复杂界面，而通过工作流指导用户完成流程，能降低人为错误的风险。

All core functionality of an operational banking system such as account management, configuration of transactions, etc.
运营银行系统的所有核心功能，如账户管理、交易配置等。

Customer 360 — Client information presented in a single view with easy-to-use navigation and configurable elements to tailor displays to individual user needs. 
客户 360° 画像 — 客户信息显示在一个视图中，具有易于使用的导航和可配置的元素，可根据每个用户需求定制展示。

Credit management and control — fully automated credit process including incoming loan applications processing, loans issuing, interest calculation and loans closure. 
信贷管理和控制 — 全自动信贷处理流程，包括贷款申请、发放、利息计算和结清。

Following the successful rebuild of Finera, IT Consultores continued to work with Jmix to develop an additional product for the banking industry, a reporting software platform called ‘Kadiko’. This solution pulls data from various IT systems in use to produce business intelligence reports. One example is Kadiko’s liquidity report which can be shared directly with the Central Bank of Paraguay to support credit applications; the applicant is sent updates such as further information required or the credit request has been approved/denied. Staff have access to a dashboard which shows updates and any reports which require further action and as a result, Kadiko significantly reduces the time spent on admin-heavy processes and report writing. 
在 Finera 成功重建之后，IT Consultores 继续与 Jmix 合作，为银行业开发一个新的产品 - 名为 “Kadiko” 的报表平台。此解决方案从各种 IT 系统中提取数据生成 BI 报表。其中有个案例是 Kadiko 生成的流动资产报告，可以直接与巴拉圭央行共享，用于支持信贷申请分析；向申请人发送更新状态，例如需要更多信息或信贷请求已被批准/拒绝。员工可以访问仪表板界面，其中展示更新内容和任何需要进一步操作的报表，因此，Kadiko 大大减少了需要人为管理的流程和报告编写上花费的时间。
