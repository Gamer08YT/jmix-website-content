## The Story
## 成功故事

CDER Group is one of the leading debt collection and enforcement agencies in the UK. The company was founded in 2004 and by 2010 its turnover exceeded £5 million. However, further growth of the company was limited due to its legacy IT infrastructure. CDER Group used an industry-standard debt enforcement solution, based on aging technology that required high levels of manual intervention and did not provide sufficient transparency to support the company’s needs.
CDER Group 是英国领先的债务追收和执行机构之一。该公司成立于2004年，到2010年，其营业额超过 500 万英镑。但是，该公司的进一步增长受到了其传统的IT基础设施限制。CDER Group 使用行业标准的债务执行解决方案，基于老旧技术，需要经常人工干预，并且没有足够的透明度支持公司新的需求。

In particular, it was almost impossible to understand what was happening "in the field" in terms of agent activity, scheduling, records of collections and financial arrangements with debtors. Despite CDER having a long list of potential improvements to the technology, because the platform was also used by multiple other bailiff companies, any enhancements that CDER suggested would be shared with their rivals, rather than driving their own competitive advantage.
特别是，几乎不可能了解在代理人活动、计划安排、收款记录和与债务人的财务安排”实地“发生了什么。尽管 CDER 对该技术有一长串将要进行的改进，但由于该平台也被多家其他类似公司使用，CDER 建议的任何增强功能都将与竞争对手分享，而不是提升自己的竞争优势。

CDER concluded that only a custom-built system would enable them to invest in a technology platform that would create business value and bring growth through delivering both efficiency and competitive advantage.
因此，CDER 的结论是，只有投资一个技术平台，通过定制的系统提高工作效率和竞争优势，才能创造商业价值并带来增长。

Haulmont business analysts conducted a complete analysis of the current business processes to draft a specification for the new system, to be known as "Hito Edge", with development start in July 2010. The first release of Hito Edge was launched in March 2011. In 2016, just five years after the Edge launch, Outsourcing Inc purchased CDER Group in a deal that valued the company at £24 million.
Haulmont 的业务分析师对当前的业务流程进行了全面分析，为新系统起草了一个规范，称为 “Hito Edge”，并于2010年7月开始开发。Hito Edge 的第一个版本于2011年3月发布。2016年，在 Edge 推出仅五年后，Outsourcing Inc 收购了 CDER Group，交易中该公司的估值为 2400 万英镑。

## How This Was Achieved
## 成就之路

Hito Edge was implemented via parallel running alongside the legacy system to minimize risk for critical business processes.
Hito Edge 与旧系统并行运行，以最大限度地降低关键业务流程的风险。

Hito Edge utilizes a propensity-driven scoring system, as well as a highly advanced dynamic allocation engine that plans agent schedules and automatically prioritizes next day planning against real-time events. All payments, fees, commissions, remittance and invoicing are managed with Hito Edge, and the agents' smartphone app enables full transparency of workflows and compliance with regulations and contractual SLAs.
Hito Edge 利用倾向驱动的评分系统，以及非常先进的动态分配引擎，可以安排代理商计划，以及根据实时事件自动确定第二天计划的优先级。所有付款，费用，佣金，汇款和发票都通过 Hito Edge 进行管理，代理商的智能手机 App 使工作流程完全透明，并符合法规和合同 SLA 的要求。

It is no exaggeration to say that Hito Edge revolutionized the debt enforcement industry with its unique customer-centric view of cases and their associated data. By focusing on the individual, the platform enables the linking of cases relating to the same customer. This ensures a more efficient process for making calls and visits, and provides users with a clearer view of the relationships between cases and customers – as well as specific data relating to individuals.
可以毫不夸张地说，Hito Edge 以其独特的以客户为中心的案件数据视图彻底改变了债务执行行业。通过专注于客户本身，该平台可以关联同一客户的所有案例。确保了更高效的电话和访问流程，并为用户提供了更清晰的案例和客户关系视图，以及与客户相关的特定数据。

CDER were able to leverage their investment into Hito Edge to increase the valuation of their operation far above the industry norms, both in terms of the solution being a unique asset to the business, and also due to its unmatched ability to scale for future business growth.
CDER 能够利用他们对 Hito Edge 的投资，将其运营估值提高到远远超过行业平均的水平，既体现了解决方案是企业的独特资产，也表明了其无与伦比的业务扩张能力。
