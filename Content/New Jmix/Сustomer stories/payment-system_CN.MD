## The Story
## 

At the beginning of 2019, the Card Access Services (CAS) team started working on a project for the Brunei government. The customer had no clear idea of the final product, so the team started to work without formal functional requirements. The only thing the CAS team knew for sure was that the system should perform plenty of operations beyond the payments processing, and the web interface must be very user-friendly, so that everyone in Brunei could easily work with it.
2019年初，Card Access Services（CAS）团队开始为文莱政府开展一个项目。客户对最终产品没有明确的概念，因此团队在开始工作时，并没有正式的功能需求说明。CAS 团队能唯一确定的是，该系统需要执行支付处理以外的大量操作，并且 Web 界面必须非常友好，以便文莱的每个人都可以轻松使用。

So, the CAS team was searching for a framework that provided out-of-the-box features for building full-scale informational systems with in-built security and tools for the UI design. Jmix (back then known as CUBA) turned out to be a perfect fit for the project.
因此，CAS 团队尝试寻找一个开发框架，提供开箱即用的功能，用于构建具有内置安全性和 UI 设计工具的全面信息系统。Jmix（当时称为CUBA）被证明是该项目的完美选择。

Jmix features helped to adapt the development to the constantly changing requirements and saved a huge amount of time. The project was launched in February 2020. It was a real break-through for the Brunei government: electronic payments were never used before. That way, CAS converted the whole country’s payment system into electronic form, making it possible to pay for electricity, water, registration, license, art gallery tickets and many other things online.
Jmix 的功能帮助开发团队适应不断变化的需求，并节省了大量的时间。该项目于2020年2月启动。这对文莱政府来说是一个真正的突破：以前从未使用过电子支付。通过这种方式，CAS 将整个国家的支付系统转换为电子形式，从而可以在线支付电费，水费，注册费，许可费，美术馆门票和许多其他费用。
