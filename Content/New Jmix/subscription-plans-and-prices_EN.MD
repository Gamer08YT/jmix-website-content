## Frequently Asked Questions

### Skills and On-boarding 
Who is the Jmix developer?
Jmix is built for professional developers. But software engineers who are still working with an outdated technology stack or newcomers with basic Java knowledge can adopt Jmix and be productive! Jmix defines application architecture and guides you to roll out the app to the web easily.


How long does it take to start productive development?
Assuming you know Java, it usually takes 1-2 weeks. If not – 1-2 months. We recommend starting with Jmix Quickstart and Video tutorials for faster onboarding.


Do you have training programs?
Yes, we have a set of training courses listed here. If you want to learn Jmix individually, contact the training center to connect to a Group Training. If you have a complete developer’s team to start learning Jmix, please contact the community manager to book the Team Training.


What kind of support do you provide?
We provide both free and paid support listed below.

FREE:
Videos. Publicly available video tutorials on basic topics here.

Sampler. Live demo of major UI patterns – check how it looks and copy-paste the code to your project.

Documentation. The platform team provides full technical documentation with code examples.

Community. Check the free Community Forum to find answers on popular topics or publish a new one and receive help from the community members and the platform team.

COMMERCIAL:
Consultancy. You can purchase consultancy hours and get support directly from Jmix team. Commercial consultancy requests receive priority over forum questions.

SLA. We provide flexible Enterprise Support Agreements.

###  License and subscription 

What can I do for free?
The Free plan has everything to build fully functional applications with Jmix. However, it lacks productivity features and advanced Add-ons of commercial tiers. Thus, we recommend using the free plan in two cases. First: you finished active development and the project is at support stage with occasional changes. Second: you've got a mature skillset in Java and you are ready to spend more time on development and learning. You can find a detailed comparison of the Jmix subscription plans here.


What is the type of Jmix license: concurrent or named?
Jmix license is named. It is connected to a certain developer profile.


Can I use my Jmix license on several workstations?
Yes. You can work with the Jmix Studio from multiple workstations using your named license, but not in parallel.


What happens when my subscription is about to expire or has expired?
If you have monthly or annual subscription auto-renewal enabled, we will:

automatically send you an email before the expiration date;
try to charge for the next subscription period according to your Jmix subscription payment terms;
if the payment succeeds, automatically renew the active subscription.
You can switch off the autorenewal option in your profile. After subscription expiration, your Jmix Studio instance will automatically toggle to the Free plan mode.


What if I decide to abandon the subscription before the expiry date?
We hope that you take the decision about the purchase carefully. That’s why we provide a trial period. The license fee is not refundable, so buy the subscription when you are sure you need it and will definitely use it. If you are not sure yet, you can always ask the community manager to prolong your trial period.


How many license keys do I need?
Each developer needs a named license, so you would need to use as many license keys as many developers you want to involve.


Can I add more developers to my subscription?
Yes. You can add additional developer seats to your active subscription in your personal account by clicking the “Manage” button.


Can I perform the upgrade of my subscription plan?
Yes, you can switch to a different plan on your subscription page.


I’m a student/teacher. Are there any educational licenses available?
Yes. We provide free Academic licenses to official educational organizations and their students. Follow the link to submit a request for an Academic license.

###  Payments and Pricing 

Does the number of end users affect Jmix license fees?
No. You pay only for developer seats, using Jmix paid subscription plans. We charge for visual tools, templates and add-ons that make your development team more productive and give the ability to deliver digital products faster. Instead of user-based pricing (runtime pricing) and usage-based pricing (connected to business value), we offer a per-developer subscription pricing model. This guarantees you the freedom to use your Jmix applications freely without restrictions.


What type of payments do you support?
We support card payments and wire transfer. You can perform the payment using the Store. If you would like to get a pro-forma invoice before payment, please choose “Offline payment” option.


Company or Individual?
A Company license is the standard licensing option for commercial and non-profit organizations. Company purchases licenses to be used by any single person within this organization.

An Individual license is an option for private individuals who purchase a license with their own funds and solely for their own use. Individual licenses are not to be purchased, refunded or in any way financed by companies. Please consider that we will regularly check the usage conditions to prevent fraud.


Do you have any volume discounts?
Yes. We provide volume discounts for the Jmix Enterprise subscription plan and higher. The volume discount depends on the number of developer seats purchased – the bigger your team, the less you pay.

Number of developers	Volume discount
5 or more	10%
10 or more	15%
20 or more	20%
30 or more	25%
Please check the subscription prices for your team in the Store.


Can I purchase a monthly subscription for the paid plans?
Yes, you can purchase a monthly subscription for Jmix RAD plan. For the Jmix Enterprise plan, annual subscription is the only option.

###  Features and Benefits 

What types of applications can I develop with Jmix?
You can develop a broad spectrum of line-of-business web applications. Please check Is Jmix right for my project? to find details.


What is the difference between the plans?
Development teams are different by their professional skillset, project specification and DevOps practices. Thus, we have different subscription plans to serve various application development profiles:

Jmix Free plan is optimum for low budget development and supporting of existing application
Jmix RAD plan perfectly suits the projects of building web CRUD applications and various Systems of Records.
Jmix Enterprise plan brings extended capabilities to the previous plan to enable business process and workflows automation, integration with Maps and other premium application components.
All subscription plans support distributed development teams with the built-in IntelliJ IDEA capabilities. Please check the Jmix plans comparison table for details.


Can I perform upgrades if the active plan features won’t be enough?
Sure. Anytime you meet the demand for features available on the higher subscription plans, you should change your plan or add users to your subscription at the profile. Please consider that we will charge only the difference in the price between subscription plans.


Where will be my data stored?
There are several options. You can store the data in your self-hosted environment or a public cloud infrastructure. Check the technical documentation for details.

###  Security and Intellectual Property 

Is Jmix secure enough to build enterprise-grade applications?
Some skeptics claim that open source is less secure than proprietary software. But it’s just a theoretical assumption. The key benefit of the open-source code is its potential to be revised by far greater “number of eyes” than a closed effort of a product team. Full access to the application code can prevent sudden failure by deep code inspection as there is nothing hidden in the “black box”.

Since 2016 the CUBA Platform is being developed as an open-source project. The platform team has continuously published a transparent product roadmap and regularly managed issue tracking on the public GitHub repository. Jmix platform, as the successor of the CUBA Platform, represents a mature open-source project based on a future-proof technology stack.

The platform maturity doesn’t exclude all security risks, so governance procedures are mandatory. But a strong community with over 25K members and more than 1000 projects done with the platform assure a strong basis for building secure applications.


Does Jmix support secure user authentication?
Yes. There are several options. In addition to the standard user-password authentication, you can connect Jmix application to the enterprise LDAP directory and synchronize end-user accounts. For secure external connections via API endpoint, Jmix provides OAuth 2.0 authentication service.


Should I pay for distributing the Apps created by Jmix?
No. You completely own the applications built with Jmix and can use them at any scale without any charges.


Do I own applications built with Jmix?
Yes. As Jmix is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license, it does not imply any substantial limitations on applications. Jmix Studio is only used at development time and is not required to run your application.


Does Jmix use third party libraries? Where can I see the full list and how are these licensed?
The full list of libraries, used by the latest Jmix and Add-ons releases, is provided here. The list of libraries, used in Jmix Studio, is available here.

All libraries we are using are distributed under open source, non-restrictive licenses - like MIT, Apache 2.0, EPL, LGPL. We do not use libraries with ‘copyleft’ licenses like GPL.

Note: Add-ons provide integration with some products, which may have commercial license - like Google Maps or amCharts. It is your responsibility to make sure you use them properly.

All forks of third-party libraries, used in Jmix, Add-ons and Studio are distributed under the same license terms as the corresponding library.
