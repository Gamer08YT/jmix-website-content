# Jmix and CUBA developers never get stuck

We provide support right from the project launch to post-production.

## We offer three support levels
depending on project phase, time constraints and budget

### Free Support

All Jmix developers are backed by a free forum and there is ample knowledge there already. We always try to answer each new question quickly but the speed heavily depends on staff availability and difficulty of the question. Many questions are also answered by fellow community members.
