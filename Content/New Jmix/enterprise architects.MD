# Secure business resilience with applications you build fast and entirely control

## Deliver line-of-business applications in record time
Jmix data-centric approach and enterprise-grade UI components facilitate record-time development or modernization of LOB applications with an extensive data model. Open architecture simplifies integrations and makes Jmix an excellent backend option for customer-facing applications with advanced administrative UI.

## Stay in control
Jmix is built around an open-source framework leveraging Spring Boot features. This guarantees full control over the source code of your applications and that any of 8+ million Java developers worldwide can support them. Jmix public infrastructure includes active community forum, extensive documentation and learning materials, so your team would hardly hit a wall.

## Keep your developers happy

Typical Low Code platforms aim to engage ‘citizen developers’, offering a high level of abstraction and purely visual development. Jmix advocates for a different approach, empowering professional developers with productive tools and API, retaining the pleasure of coding in a familiar environment.



Depending on the project lifecycle, Jmix boosts the development several times compared to custom open-source stack development. This is achieved by the platform’s main features: a greatly elaborated “enterprise core” and modularization.

By the enterprise core we mean:

- Data model based on entities (objects)
- Role based access control
- Session management and scalability
And by modularization we mean Studio features (development speed up and unification of development approaches) and modules reuse (not just code snippets, but full-fledged modules with internal business-logic and a common core).
