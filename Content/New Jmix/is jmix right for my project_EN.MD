# Is Jmix Right for My Project?

## Line-of-Business Applications

The mission of Jmix is to offer superior productivity and simplicity for developing Line-of-Business (LOB) web applications. These are applications, which run the business either on the company, divisional or departmental level. Examples represent a broad spectrum from spreadsheets to highly specialized custom systems classified as ERP, CRM, EAM, SCM, WMS, ECM, ERM, HRM.

### Typical LOB applications characteristics:

Non-trivial business logic or processes automation

Extensive data model

Uniform and functional UI, often hundreds of screens

Users are mostly company employees or partners

## Team profile

The unique feature of Jmix is the ability to use Java or trendy Kotlin both for backend and frontend development. The benefits of one language for the whole stack cannot be underestimated: a single developer can implement a complete feature from data storage to web interface, eliminating frictions between web and backend teams. Mono language coding with high-level API makes Jmix the easiest option to onboard developers with experience in other server side languages or obsolete technologies like FoxPro, Oracle Forms, MS Access, Lightswitch, Silverlight, Delphi.

## More use cases for Jmix

Modernize applications
Automate internal workflows and processes
Eliminate SaaS/Low-code vendor fees and limitations


##  When should I consider different options?

Like any platform, Jmix is not a silver bullet. You might want to consider alternatives when:

01 - You have web-only or dedicated web and backend teams and established design-first or API-first development practices. Even if Jmix is a good match, you might want to stick to the already adopted development practices.

02 - The application uses most of its data from external sources or has a very basic data model.

03 - Custom UI design and web-scale are critical, and you are prepared to wait longer and pay extra for it. In this case, consider Jmix as a powerful backend with an advanced admin interface.

04 - The project is already running. Jmix is intended for starting new projects and would rarely apply to those already well on the way to production.

05 - You donâ€™t have access to professional developers; your project is a reasonably simple or standard application. Consider No Code or Low Code alternatives in those scenarios but bear in mind license fees and limitations.
