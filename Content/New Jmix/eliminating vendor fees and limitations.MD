# Eliminating Vendor Fees and Limitations

## Replace expensive vendor solutions with applications you own and control

Typical Low Code and BPMS Platforms offer very low barriers to entry as well as extremely fast and free development. This makes them so tempting to choose for your next project. But when it’s time to rollout, you may face the other side of LCAP or BPMS: high fees tied to the number of users and consumed resources and complicated customization of anything beyond standard platform capabilities.

Sometimes you find yourself in a similar situation with SaaS products. When they work, they work great, but sometimes the “value per money” just isn’t right, or you get stuck with the limits of what can be customized. As a result, 29% of midsize enterprises reported in Gartner survey that between 25% and 49% of the subscriptions with their top three SaaS vendors are currently idle.


## The obvious way to overcome those challenges is migration to a custom developed solution. In this scenario, Jmix provides an efficient alternative to classic development:
