# Data Tools

## Entity Inspector

Entity Inspector provides auto-generated UI for your data model entities. It allows you to browse, create, update and remove entity instances without creating any specific UI. Also, if your entity is soft-deleted, Entity Inspector lets you browse, restore or wipe out deleted instances.

Entity Inspector respects data access constraints imposed by security, so it can be helpful both for administrators and for users with limited permissions.

## Entity Information Action

A UI action that displays a system information about a selected entity. It includes the entity name, Java class, database table, identifier, and values of system attributes that constitute the entity traits.
