# OpenID Connect

Integration with OIDC providers for external authentication and SSO.

## Overview

The Jmix OpenID Connect add-on provides predefined Spring Security configurations and a set of services that allow you to easily implement the following functionality:

- User authentication using an external OIDC provider (for example, Keycloak).
- Mapping of user attributes and roles from an OIDC provider user to a Jmix user.
- Persisting user entity and role assignments after the user is successfully authenticated at the OIDC provider.
