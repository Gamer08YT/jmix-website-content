# Masquerade
## Jmix UI testing library

Masquerade is a library for automated testing of Jmix user interface. With the help of this library, you can create end-to-end tests in Java or Kotlin and run them manually or in your CI environment.

Masquerade allows you to separate test scenarios from the complexity of the UI elements under test. Firstly, you describe the UI screen content declaratively in a simple Java or Kotlin class with annotated fields, and then you use this class in test scenarios as a substitute of the real UI elements.

Masquerade is based on Selenide and Selenium.
