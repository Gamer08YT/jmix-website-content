# LDAP

## Overview

The add-on provides an easy way to enable LDAP authentication in Jmix applications. It allows you to synchronize users and map LDAP groups and user attributes to Jmix security roles. The add-on also supports the case when users are managed only in LDAP and you don't have a user entity stored in the database.

You can use the add-on with Active Directory and with any other LDAP implementation.

CAUTION: The add-on currently has experimental status and may introduce breaking changes in the next feature release.
