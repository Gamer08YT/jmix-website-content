# Business Calendars

Provides API and UI for working with business days and hours.

## Overview

The add-on allows you to manage business calendars containing holidays, scheduled and additional business days. Configured business calendars provide API to work with business days and hours.

Business calendars can be defined at design time using annotated Java interfaces, or created at run time through the UI and stored in the database.

The business calendar API allows you to check if a date and time moment is a working hour, and provides date/time arithmetics considering business hours.
