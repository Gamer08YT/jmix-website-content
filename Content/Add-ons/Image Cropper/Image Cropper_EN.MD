# Image Cropper

## Overview
In modern enterprise applications, uploading image is a popular requirement, for example, upload ID Card images, avatar images or image attachments etc. Almost all applications have restriction on image size, in order to reduce upload time and stored file size.

Generally, the original image does not fit the size requirement, we need to process the raw image to fit the application restriction. This component will be helpful for processing the original image.
