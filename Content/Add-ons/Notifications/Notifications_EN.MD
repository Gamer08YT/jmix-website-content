# Notifications

Enables sending notification to users via various message channels.

## Overview

The add-on allows you to create and send notifications via various message channels. Users can receive informational messages, notifications about system events, as well as notifications from business processes.

By default, the add-on provides two channels: in-app (for UI notifications) and email. Other channels can be added on the project level.

In-app notifications are shown by the special UI component which can be added to the main screen of the application.

Notifications can be created and sent using a UI screen provided by the add-on, or through the API. There is also an integration with the BPM add-on which enables sending notifications from business processes.
