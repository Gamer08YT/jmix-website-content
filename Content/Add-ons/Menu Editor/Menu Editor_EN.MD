# Menu Editor

Provides support of multiple main menus in Jmix applications.

## OVERVIEW

The add-on provides support of multiple main menus in Jmix applications. Menus are stored in the database
and can be created and edited at runtime using the administration screens.

Main functions:
- allow to change menu structure and menu items properties (caption, shortcut, icon, etc) using the administration screens
  at runtime.
- allow to use multiple main menus with different structure for different use groups

Use cases:
- administrators need to change the main menu at runtime without development and deployment of a new application version.
- different user groups need main menus with different structure, these menus must be configurable.
